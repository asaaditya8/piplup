This exercise compiles successfully. The remaining exercises contain a compiler
or logic error. The central concept behind Rustlings is to fix these errors and
solve the exercises. Good luck!

The source for this exercise is in `exercises/intro/intro1.rs`. Have a look!
Going forward, the source of the exercises will always be in the success/failure output.""")
