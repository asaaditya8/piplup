# piplup

Greetings and welcome to piplup. This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Python code. This includes reading and responding to error messages!

This project is inspired from the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project.

# Getting Started
_We recommend you to use VSCode with Jupyter extension and Auto-Save disabled, as the watch command re-runs exercises when a modified file is saved. Jupyter Notebook/Lab keeps saving your files at regular intervals thus your code will execute multiple times unnecessarily._
You will need to have either Jupyter or some other IDE installed to edit `.ipynb` files.

```bash
pip install piplup
```
